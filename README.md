# Hospital-Dashboard---Power-BI


Project Overview

The Hospital Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution designed to provide a comprehensive view of hospital performance, patient outcomes, doctor efficiency, treatment effectiveness, and diagnostic quality. This dashboard transforms raw healthcare data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency.

Project Highlights

Built an end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor hospital operations, patient care, treatment performance, and financial health.
Implemented clear KPIs, visual storytelling, and actionable insights to enable decision-makers to assess hospital performance effectively.

Dashboard Views

1. Patients View

Analyze total patients, average stay duration, and readmission rates.
Visualize patient volume trends, recovery performance, and hospital comparisons across regions and departments.

2. Doctors View

Evaluate doctor performance using patient recovery rates and total cases handled.
Compare departments and identify top-performing doctors based on recovery and workload metrics.

3. Treatments View

Track treatment performance via revenue, profitability, and satisfaction scores.
